**CIS 442 Project**

Requirements:
    - Users should use Python 3.10 or greater to run the code of this project.
    - User must run the main.py program to execute and find masqueraded files.


Setup Requirements:

    Clone project repo down to local computer

    Using terminal with Python create a local python enviroment in the repo folder:
        
        Step 1: Create environment (maybe python or python3 in your terminal)
            Mac/Linux/Windows: python -m venv .env
                               python3 -m venv .env

        Step 2: Activate the python venv
            Windows: call .\.env\Scripts\activate

            Mac/Linux: source ./.env/bin/activate

    Now that venv is active use Python to execute main.py
        python main.py
        python3 main.py

    At this point the GUI should pop up from running the main.py


Using the GUI:

    - You may type in a directory in the top box, this could be a absolute path or a relative path to 
      the main.py file you are running or where ever your current working directory is.
        -> If a dirctory is invalid the program will notify you that it is invalid in the output box at bottom of GUI
           after pressing the "Run" button
    
    - There is also a "Browse Directory" button this will allow you to select a directory from your
      file explorer GUI, this could be (Finder (Mac), File Explorer (Windows), etc...)

    - Once your directory is input or selected from "Browse Dirctory" then you may press the "Run" button,
      this will search within that directory identifying files that are masqueraded printing them to the 
      output box at the bottom of the GUI
        -> This output box is scrollable if there are many masqueraded files
